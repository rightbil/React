## two type of exports
1. named export - we can not change the name of the function when import {named}.
2. defautl export - we can change the name of the function when we import.
## both class and function components 
take props optionally, and return Html/ JSP
Components are re-usable
# class functions are ES6 Classes.
apart from the probs class components maintain private data also called state 
# Hooks
are added to functions to add state at later version 
# JSX - Java Script XML - extension of JS syntax
return always return only one tag eg everything included in one div tag, no separate lines of code are allowed.
